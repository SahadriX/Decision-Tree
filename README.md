## 🌳 Decision-Tree

A project implementing a **Decision Tree classifier** to solve classification problems using a structured dataset. This project covers the full machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

---

### 🧠 Project Objective
To build an interpretable classification model that:
- Utilizes **decision trees** for clear decision logic 🌳  
- Processes and cleans data effectively 🧹  
- Evaluates model accuracy using various metrics 📊

---

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 scikit-learn  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

### 🧩 Key Features
- 🔍 Full ML pipeline: preprocessing, training, testing  
- 🌳 Decision Tree classification with clear interpretability  
- 📊 Visualizations of accuracy metrics (confusion matrix, feature importance)  
- 📈 Highlights decision rules and tree structure for transparency

---

### 🧮 How the Model Works
1. **Data preprocessing**: cleaning and preparing the dataset  
2. **Feature selection**: choosing relevant variables  
3. **Train-test split**: separating data for validation  
4. **Model training**: fitting a Decision Tree classifier  
5. **Evaluation**: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
6. **Visualization**: plotting decision tree and metrics
